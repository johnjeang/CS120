    <h2>Recent Trip</h2>h2>
    <p>Last summer I took a trip to France to visit my sister and her husband. They recently
        moved there for graduate school, and were soon to be married. As a wedding present 
        to them, I bought them tickets to the Olympics; we watched swimming, cycling, 
        kayaking, and track! The weather was beautiful, albeit a bit hot, but I had the 
        chance to visit the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, and the Arc de Triomphe.</p>

    <h2>My Favorite Pet Names</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A Turtle named Gatsby</li>
        <li>A Dog named Admiral</li>
        <li>A Snake named Newton</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>My Favorite Foods</h2>

My favorite restaurant is a small Korean Fried Chicken place called Bonchon. The website can be found <a href="https://www.bonchon.com/" target="_blank">here.</a>
Though it is a chain, it is my favorite because I grew up with one near my house and have many fond memories of eating there with my family and friends. Though salty
there is plenty of sweet heat and protein in every bite!

        Korean Fried Chicken is one of my favorite foods. The crispy texture and spicy sauce make it irresistible. I love eating it with pickled 
        radish and a cold drink! I will admit however that it is not the healthiest option, so it should be enjoyed in moderation.
